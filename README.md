# Development Guide

## Realm World

Fun, Simple, Open To Play And Develop

## World Generation

The World Generation code is very simple and modular so you can use the code your self!

All the world generation stuff is in [`Assets/Environment/World`](Assets\Environment\World)

Read the [`World/README.txt`](Assets\Environment\World\README.txt) to see simple dependents of each folder

Currently you just need to edit [`TerrainChunk.cs`](<Assets\Environment\World\Terrain Chunk\TerrainChunk.cs>) to change everything how to it generate itself
